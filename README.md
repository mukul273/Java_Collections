This is practice for 
# algorithms and data structures using Java colletions

##1. Given a list of words 
 = [‘LOOPED’, ‘ALLERGY’, ‘GALLERY’, ‘LARGELY’, ‘POODLE’, ‘CARROT’], return a list of distinct and complete sets of anagrams. Anagrams are words that use the same letters with the exact same number of occurrences. For the previous example, the expected output would be [[‘LOOPED’, ‘POODLE’], [‘ALLERGY’, ‘GALLERY’, ‘LARGELY’]]. The sets returned should each have at least two words in them.

##2. Word Game
Imagine you are building a word game similar to Scrabble or Words With Friends. Players draw letter tiles from a large set and must spell words with their currently available tiles. As part of the implementation you need to check whether a given move is valid, i.e. is it possible to spell a particular word with a particular set of tiles? For example, tiles = [ ‘B’, ‘Z’, ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘Z’, ‘D’ ], word = ‘BED’ => yes, word = ‘BEDS’ => no
